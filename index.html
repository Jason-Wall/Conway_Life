            <div>The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.<br><br></div>
            <div>The game follows a simple set of rules:</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation;</li>
                <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation;</li>
                <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation;</li>
                <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
            </ul>
